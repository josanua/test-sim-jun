# Small test description
I dedicated about two hours per day to this task, and it took approximately two and a half days in total. Some libraries were new to me, and I also needed to refresh my memory on certain principles.

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Styled-components used (in small proportion).
* Get data from graphql API
* Data fetching with Apollo
* Added infinite scroll without libraries
* ChatGPT help (nothing complicated was speed necessary), Good bless :)

Didn't:
* Use SCSS
* Apollo Pagination
* Added article page and link to

# Author thoughts
For me, the most important aspect was to test myself, and I thank you for the opportunity. I haven't used React in a while, and the key takeaway was understanding that I have grasped the basic principles. The rest comes with experience.
